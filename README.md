My friends and I have been impacted by the mass layoffs and economics downturn in the US. I was wondering if the US is the sole country where companies experience layoffs, which company has the highest number of layoffs as well as the overall magnitude of people affected by them.

## Data source
I downloaded the data from March 2020 to June 2023 on the website [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/) (Primary data source)

## Questions and Hypothesis
1. Did the recent layoffs primarily affect the US and not other countries?

   *Hypothesis: Yes, only in the US due to economic downturn.*

2. Which year witnessed the highest number of layoffs?

   *Hypothesis: 2020 (COVID-19 Pandemic)*

3. What industries have experienced the highest number of layoffs globally?

   *Hypothesis: Hospitality, tourism, IT due to economic downturn and COVID-19*

4. Which company has had the most layoffs?

   *Hypothesis: General Electric (GE), IBM, or Walmart, due to restructuring, automation, changes in market demand, financial challenges*
